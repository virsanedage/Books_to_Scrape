# Books_to_Scrape
This project demonstrates web scraping using Python through a Jupyter Notebook.
The scraper extracts book information from the practice website Books to Scrape and stores the data in a structured CSV file for analysis.

## Website scraped: https://books.toscrape.com

## This website is publicly available and created for learning web scraping.

## Project Overview
Web scraping is an essential skill for data collection.
In this project, I built a beginner-friendly scraper that collects book data using Requests, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.
The main implementation is done inside a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), making the logic easy to understand and visually inspect.
